# Siamese-Network-TripletLoss
This project implements a Siamese network with triplet loss for duplicate question detection. It includes data preprocessing, vocabulary creation, Siamese model construction with LSTM layers, and training using triplet loss. The model evaluates question similarity and predicts duplicates with high accuracy.
